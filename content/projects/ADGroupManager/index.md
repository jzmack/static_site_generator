## Overview

Automates adding long lists of users to specific AD groups, replacing a slow and painful manual process. Users are also verified after added.

## Why I made this

Our previous process managing AD group memberships was time-consuming and error-prone. This tool increased efficiency of this process **~98%** and freed us up to do other tasks.

## Time saving impact

- **Manually:** ~81 seconds first user + 21 seconds per additional user
- **Scripted:** ~5 users/second
- **Real Example**: 189 users would've taken **~64 min** manually vs. **40 seconds** scripted

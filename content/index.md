Welcome to my lil man cave, personal blog, whatever you wanna call it. Here, I'll share some stuff I find interesting. This could be anything from tech, video games, hip hop, or stuff related to A Song of Ice and Fire.

Just thought this quote was cool as it inspired the entire ASOIAF series.

## Reasons I like A Song of Ice and Fire

- Rich lore you can spend years studying still find out new things all the time
- It's dark fantasy, but somehow has relatable characters and situations
- There are parallels to real world politics and history
- Swords, tits, and magic man

## My favorite characters (in no order)

1. Eddard, Robb, Arya Stark
2. Sandor Clegane
3. Olenna & Margery Tyrell
4. Ygritte
5. Cersei, Jaime, Tywin Lannister
6. Varys
7. Robert Baratheon
8. Petyr Baelish
9. Bronn

Here's what `elflang` looks like (just to show some code formatting):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Aiya, Ambar!")
}
```

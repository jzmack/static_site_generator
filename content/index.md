# My lil man cave 

![Me](/images/me.jpg)

Welcome to my lil man cave personal blog whatever you wanna call is. Here, I'll share some stuff I find interesting. This could be anything from tech, video games, hip hop, or stuff related to A Song of Ice and Fire. 

Special thanks to [this course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python) on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) that made this site possible.

## Reasons I like Tolkien

- You can spend years studying the legendarium and still not understand its depths
- It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
- Disney _didn't ruin it_ (okay, but Amazon might have)
- It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

Here's what `elflang` looks like (the perfect coding language):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Aiya, Ambar!")
}
```

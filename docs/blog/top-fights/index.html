        <div><h1>Top 5 Fights in Game of Thrones</h1><p>The Game of Thrones TV show is all about politics, schemes, plots (schemes and plots are the same thing…?), and sex… And these have all lead to some epic fight scenes. These are my top 5 favorite fight scenes. Special shout out to the Cargyll's from House of the Dragon because their sword fight might be better than all of these from Game of Thrones.</p><h2>Ned Stark vs. Jaime Lannister (Season 1 Episode 5)</h2><p><img src="/static_site_generator/images/ned-vs-jaime.jpg" alt="Ned vs Jaime"></img></p><p>Foreshadowed since the Pilot episode and mentioned in the story ever since Ned found Jaime sitting on the Iron Throne after killing the Mad King, this fight was bound to happen. These two had been spewing out fighting words and not-so-friendly banter at each other during King Bobby B’s welcoming feast in Winterfell. A feast that was supposed to be more of a celebration for Ned becoming Hand of the King. Jaime has a knack for competition especially when it comes to fighting as he is known to be one of, if not the best swordsman alive at that point. Sparked off by the Catelyn's capturing of Tyrion Lannister, accused of attempting to murder Bran, mixed with the Ned's unbreakable honor and loyalty to his wife (“he was taken at my command”) lead to this exciting clash of two great warriors. Unfortunately, we do not get a winner for this one, so we can only speculate who would have won this. I do like how Jaime gets pissed at the guy for stabbing Ned in the leg. It shows how Jaime has some honor when it comes to combat and respects the 1v1.</p><h2>Sandor Clegane vs. Gregor Clegane aka Cleganebowl (Season 8 Episode 5)</h2><p><img src="/static_site_generator/images/sandor-gregor.jpg" alt="Sandor vs Gregor"></img></p><p>Queue the airhorns. While season 8 was not exactly on par with the rest of the show, it gave us one of the most epic and cinematic fight scenes. Stemming back since season 1 where we Littlefinger tells us the history of the Hound's nasty facial scars, Cleganebowl was something most fans were dying to see, and it happened in spectacular fashion. Say what you want about season 8, but there is so much to love about this scene. I love the way Cersei calmy evacuates before the brawl and no one bats and eye. Qyburn getting absolutely clapped by his Frankenstein-like creation. The fight itself was brutal and you can almost feel each heavyweight hit these guys throw at each other. All the while Drogon is flying and wreaking havoc in the background.  A fight of epic proportions that is a fitting ending for both characters. Sandor was burned by the fire early on by his brother, and essentially conquers that fear by throwing himself in it with Gregor.</p><h2>Gregor vs. Oberyn Martell (Season 4 Episode 8)</h2><p><img src="/static_site_generator/images/oberyn-gregor.jpg" alt="Gregor vs Oberyn"></img></p><p>Many consider season 4 of Game of Thrones to be its peak, and this scene is one of the most shocking in the entire show. Leading up to this, we have Tyrion, accused of killing regicide after King Joffrey was poisoned at his own wedding, dying gruesomely in his mother's arms. Tyrion thought he could count on his handy sell-sword Bronn, who declines to be his champion. Then we are left wondering, how is Tyrion going to get out of this one? In comes Oberyn Martell, Prince of Dorne and certified badass. This guy just drinks, fights, and fucks. Oberyn hates Lannisters, specifically Tywin and especially hates the Mountain who raped his sister, killer her, and her children. The stars align and he finally gets a chance to bring justice to Gregor Clegane. Surprising everyone, Oberyn's dexterity and expertise with a spear gives him the upper hand in the fight. All it took was one single moment of hubris to end it all. I would call this fight a draw. If it were not for Qyburn turning Gregor into an undead zombie, he would have perished due to this fight.</p><h2>Sandor vs. Brienne of Tarth (Season 4 Episode 10)</h2><p><img src="/static_site_generator/images/brienne-sandor" alt="Brienne vs Sandor"></img></p><p>These Clegane’s sure get into a lot of fights. At the center of this clash, we have Arya Stark, who was kidnapped by the Hound. These two end up spending a lot of time together, eventually forming a bond. The two have a lot in common, I mean they really like killing people. On the other side we have Brienne, who swore an oath to Catelyn Stark that she would find her children and keep them safe. When Brienne finally catches up with Arya, she is naturally only met with suspicion. Arya's journey this far was rough. Being kidnapped, killing people, and watching as the hound robs the innocent. Purely good people like Brienne are an anomaly in Westeros which explains why Arya is not quick to trust her. The fight itself was sudden, bloody, and brutal. These two are juggernauts and some of the best fighters in Westeros and they beat the absolute piss and shit out of each other. The Hound grabs her Valyrian steel blade, Brienne kicks him in the nuts, the Hound... does the same. But unlike the rest of these fights, there is a clear winner. Brienne gets the upper hand with a rock and goes to town on the Hound. It is after this fight that we learn that Arya cares about the Hound when she does not execute him at his request.</p><h2>Ned Stark and the boys vs. Arthur Dayne & Gerold Hightower (Season 6 Episode 3)</h2><p><img src="/static_site_generator/images/tower-joy.jpg" alt="Tower of Joy fight"></img></p><p>A famous skirmish referenced multiple times in the books and show. The legendary Arthur Dayne, Sword of the Morning, alongside Gerold Hightower, Lord Commander of the King’s Guard under Aerys Targaryen take on Ned Stark, Howland Reed, and 4 other Northmen. Ned is famous for winning this fight and we get glimpses of his perspective when he is dreaming, but it's not until we actually see the event via Bran's greensight, that we get the details for how it went down. Ned isolated the 1v1 with Gerold Hightower and makes quick work of him, however, Ser Arthur Dayne is a different breed of warrior. In this fight, he would wield two swords, including House Dayne's family sword Dawn, the Sword of the Morning. Regarded by many as the greatest knight to have ever lived, he picks off Ned's men one by one with ease until it is just him vs. Ned. Ned puts up a fight but is out skilled, outclassed, and disarmed by the end of the fight. If not for Howland Reed…</p></div>
